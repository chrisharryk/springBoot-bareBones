# Barebones Spring Boot API with the Spring Data JPA

## What's theis about?
* Just an API written in Spring Boot
* Revolves around the "Student" entity and works with the Spring Data JPA to save and retrieve data from a relational DB
* Does not have a user interface, works entierly on request URLs and JSONs
* DB used is PostgreSQL
* The controller, service and the repository layers are in their distinct folders

PS: I need to work on better artifact names
